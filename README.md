# Hacker News Bar
hnBar is a OSX menu status bar application let you access HackerNews front page one click

## Motivation
A similar software cost $2 dollar on AppStroe. As a hacker by heart I don't wanna pay...

## Introduction

This software runs menu status bar, currently displays the latest front page on the menu.

The setting window currently has a master-detail like UI which does a full text search for user input and displays the results in the table on the left side. Eventually I would like to implement features such as filtering and archiving news based on user defined configuration.
