# Hacker News Bar
hnBar is a OSX menu bar application let you access Tech News site HackerNews's front page with one click. This is a **half baked** product, but if you just wanna a handy access to hacker news, this works pretty well.
## Installation
git clone and open it with Xcode. Build and Run..
I will provide a dmg file upon request

Motivation
==========
A similar software cost $2 dollar on AppStroe. I could save it and learn some new technology...

Introduction
============

This software runs menu status bar, currently displays the latest front page on the menu.

The setting window currently has a master-detail like UI which does a full text search for user input and displays the results in the table on the left side. Eventually I would like to implement features such as filtering and archiving news based on user defined configuration.
